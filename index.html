			 <p>I have been really looking forward to exploring new creative hobbies and getting back to my ever-growing to-be-read pile this year. So far, I have been keeping a sketchbook journal, drawing with acrylic markers, being creative with fashion, baking new things, painting wooden beads, and slowly learning embroidery. I also got a cross-stitching kit for Christmas, so that’s next on the list.</p>
<p>I started reading John Berger’s “Bento’s Sketchbook.” There is something nice about not having chapters—his thoughts just flow from one page to another. It feels like spending an afternoon with a wholesome old man.</p>
<p>Being snowed in reminds me a bit of lockdown. And the world feels heavy in a different way. I catch myself yearning for community, waiting for a neighbor to come knocking on our door, perhaps to borrow some sugar (or toilet paper?).</p>
<p>Are you snowed in, too? How is everyone feeling? Do you have new hobbies you want to explore (or already started) this year?
Any books you’re currently enjoying?</p>

			 <p>The beginning of this year feels different.</p>
<p>I lost my aunt 4 days into the new year. Paranasal sinus cancer had spread to her brain, and the doctors said it was too late for any treatment. I wish it was a bad dream. She had been like a mother to me. When I was growing up, both of my parents frequently worked seven days a week, so my aunt would take care of me and my brother on most weekends. When I left Thailand three years ago for my MFA, I gave my aunt a hug goodbye, not knowing it meant forever. While I grieve her loss, a part of me still feels like she should be there when I return.</p>
<p>At the same time, I feel the kindness of God in all of this. My aunt didn’t experience the level of pain typically associated with this type of cancer, and she found peace in a belief in Jesus through her diagnosis. The hopefulness surrounding her loss also inspired my other aunts and uncle to want to hear more about God.</p>
<p>It feels to me like an end and a beginning at the same time. I look at life a little differently and say “I love you” a little more unsparingly.</p>
<p>It was a full moon on the night that she passed. I remember my aunt mentioning how she did not like her name because it sounds old-fashioned. Her name, จันทร์เพ็ญ means “full moon.” Now that I am older, I think it’s a beautiful name and it suits her. I know I will miss her every time I see the moon. In fact, I will miss her everyday.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://challenges.micro.blog/">Day 4: Evergreen</a>. Woke up to beautiful morning light in our festive space, so I did my best to capture it. Loving our tree and mixed garland this year (and of course that fresh pine scent that fills the hallway).</p>

			 <p>Thought it&rsquo;d be fun to join the December photo challenge—the prompts are so fun! Here is <a href="https://challenges.micro.blog/2025/12/17/days-of-winter-wonder-photo.html">day 3: firelight</a>. Today&rsquo;s prompt reminded me that I should light candles more often, especially in the colder months.</p>

			 <p>Today is my birthday. 34 times around the sun—how did I get so old?  I usually don&rsquo;t talk much about my birthday. It can feel kind of funny, like &ldquo;hey, celebrate me!&rdquo; You know? Maybe because we usually don&rsquo;t make too big of a deal on birthdays in Thailand (at least not in my family anyway). But as I get older, I am allowing myself to celebrate myself more. I am thankful to be alive and I&rsquo;m just grateful. I didn&rsquo;t really know what I wanted to do this year, so I invited two of my friends over last minute for some lighthearted watercolor painting. I was going to buy some flowers so we could paint them, but I caved last minute and bought some fun looking veggies instead (and hey, we can eat them later!). My husband, Jacob, made a triple berry and lemon galette with thyme crust and homemade whipped cream for me (with vegan butter and non-dairy cream of course because lactose intolerance). It was so wonderful. He also got me an embroidery kit—something I&rsquo;ve been wanted to try for a while now. My friends Claire and Nikki brought me cards and flowers. We spent the afternoon enjoying the berry galette with a pot of earl grey and painting some veggies and flowers. My heart is full.</p>

<p>I felt inspired so I did a whimsical little illustration of what I wore today. This has been my go-to outfit this summer (alternating between these two pairs of mary jane shoes and my two favorite handmade bags from Thailand). And no, I do not wear heirloom tomatoes. I’ve been into heirloom tomatoes lately—just the look of them I guess, because I haven’t eaten any recently. Anyways, I have so much fun mixing and matching colors, textures, and patterns when it comes to clothes. These olive yellow linen shorts paired with the boxy light blue button-down make me want to dance. I’ve worn this to the secondhand bookstore, the local boutique shop, a grocery run, soil shopping (to re-pot our poor plants), the library, etc. Maybe I should wear this to the farmer’s market sometime. I suppose I should fill my closet with multiple of these and have one outfit for the entire season. Summer is my jam because you can have so much fun wearing colorful things.

			 <p>Hello there. Here I am in my 30s writing my first blog post EVER (better late than never, right?). My name is Sai and I&rsquo;m from Bangkok, Thailand. My blog is called oatmilk because I&rsquo;m lactose intolerant. And here&rsquo;s a picture of me on expired film.</p>
