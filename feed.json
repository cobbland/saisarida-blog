I was going to buy some flowers so we could paint them, but I caved last minute and bought some fun looking veggies instead (and hey, we can eat them later!). My husband, Jacob, made a triple berry and lemon galette with thyme crust and homemade whipped cream for me (with vegan butter and non-dairy cream of course because lactose intolerance). It was so wonderful. He also got me an embroidery kit—something I&rsquo;ve been wanted to try for a while now. My friends Claire and Nikki brought me cards and flowers.
